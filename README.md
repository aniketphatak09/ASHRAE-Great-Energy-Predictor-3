# ASHRAE-Great-Energy-Predictor-3


•	Developed an energy prediction model using K-fold Cross-Validation and Light Gradient Boosting decision tree (LGB).
•	Utilized optimal hyperparameter tuning to achieve an RMSE of 0.76; also performed feature engineering and data analysis to compose models built on LSTM and fully connected Neural Network.
